# Neural_networks
Implementing neural networks in C
We are first going to make basic matrix operations which will help us in making the neural network.
We have current developed the basic operations needed.
We are working on implementing the network with backpropagation in C and optimization using pthreads and openMP

#update 1

forward pass and backward pass working
